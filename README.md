🧠📊 I Built a Personal Health Score Dashboard Using My Apple Health Data!

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a data science passion project—creating a custom Health Score from my own Apple Health data—and the insights have been eye-opening.

Using Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn) and PowerBI, I:

✅ Cleaned and merged health + sleep data  
✅ Modeled missing values (VO₂ Max, sleep stages, exercise, respiratory rate)  
✅ Normalized metrics using min-max normalization 
✅ Weighted key indicators based on research  
✅ Built a daily 0–1 Health Score to visualize trends  

Metrics used:
• VO₂ Max  
• Resting HR & HRV  
• Respiratory Rate  
• Active Energy & Stand Time  
• Core, Deep, REM Sleep  

✏️ Key Takeaways

▶️ More data = better insights. A longer tracking period would unlock richer trends.  
▶️ Apple Health is powerful, but access to things like screen time is still limited. Seriously, I wish the screen time data was more available!

💡The next best thing would be to set up a pipeline to automatically pull the health data. Let me know if you’ve figured that out!
